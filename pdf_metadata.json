      "authors": [

      "abstract": "This is a concise mathematical introduction to Monte Carlo methods, a rich family\nof algorithms with far-reaching applications in science and engineering. Monte Carlo methods\nare an exciting subject for mathematical statisticians and computational and applied mathemati-\ncians: the design and analysis of modern algorithms are rooted in a broad mathematical toolbox\nthat includes ergodic theory of Markov chains, Hamiltonian dynamical systems, transport maps,\nstochastic differential equations, information theory, optimization, Riemannian geometry, and\ngradient flows, among many others. These lecture notes celebrate the breadth of mathematical\nideas that have led to tangible advancements in Monte Carlo methods and their applications. To\naccommodate a diverse audience, the level of mathematical rigor varies from chapter to chapter,\ngiving only an intuitive treatment to the most technically demanding subjects. The aim is not to\nbe comprehensive or encyclopedic, but rather to illustrate some key principles in the design and\nanalysis of Monte Carlo methods through a carefully-crafted choice of topics that emphasizes\ntimeless over timely ideas. Algorithms are presented in a way that is conducive to conceptual\nunderstanding and mathematical analysis —clarity and intuition are favored over state-of-the-art\nimplementations that are harder to comprehend or rely on ad-hoc heuristics. To help readers\nnavigate the expansive landscape of Monte Carlo methods, each algorithm is accompanied by a\nsummary of its pros and cons, and by a discussion of the type of problems for which they are\nmost useful. The presentation is self-contained, and therefore adequate for self-guided learning\nor as a teaching resource. Each chapter contains a section with bibliographic remarks that will\nbe useful for computational scientists and graduate students interested in conducting research on\nMonte Carlo methods and their applications.",
